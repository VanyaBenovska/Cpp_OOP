Task 09_01_Randomize
You are given a list of words in one line. Randomize their order and print each word at a separate line.
Also, to implement this task you should write a class that is initialized with a linear container (array, vector, etc.) 
of words and which has a getRandomized() method which returns the words randomized. Each call to getRandomized() should return 
a different ordering of the words.
